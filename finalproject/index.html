    <h2>Billy Grant</h2>
    <h3>Quality Assurance Accessibility Audit Conducted on <a target='_blank' href='http://research.umich.edu/leadership'>http://research.umich.edu/leadership</a></h3>
    <ul>1.	Run through each page with the WAVE Chrome Extension.</ul>
    <li>15 errors for images without alt text</li>
    <li>2 errors for empty links</li>
    <li>30 contrast errors – light blue text on light grey, yellow on white</li><br>
    <ul>2.	Users should be able to navigate through content using their keyboard.</ul>
    <li>Tabbing goes to social icons at the bottom of the page first</li>
    <li>Good option to skip to main content</li>
    <li>Tabs through menu options well but not easy to follow the tabbing in between the menu and the leadership team section. Goes to a list of links not visible on the screen – they’re off to the left</li><br>
    <ul>3.	Users should be able to navigate content using a screen reader.</ul>
    <li>Menus and links are easily tabbed and read via screen reader.</li>
    <li>However, same issue as listed before in terms of it reading a large section of tabbed items that are off the screen to the left. </li><br>
    <ul>4.	The general architecture and hierarchy of the content should make sense.</ul>
    <li>Headers exist and make structural sense. Most clickable elements have clear indication.</li>
    <li>Cards used to group related content for each member of the leadership team (name, image, details, go button)</li>
    <li>Content is grouped clearly to show what is related and generally most pertinent to the page</li><br>
    <ul>5.	Charts and images should all have alt-text so that users with screen readers or users on a slow connection will still be able to understand the images.</ul>
    <li>Most of the images on the page are of the leadership team and only one of them has alt-text</li><br>
    <h3>Suggestions:</h3>
    <p>1. Be consistent with the treatment of the leadership images. Add alt-text to enhance accessibility if the images are not considered as merely decoration. If it is decided that they are decorative, then remove the alt text that is only provided for one of the leadership members to match what was done for all of the others. Either of these routes will improve the accessibility of the site as users will be less confused as a result of consistency. </p>
    <p>2. Address the information is currently off screen to the left that can only be accessed via tab. If this information is not meant to be accessed, eliminate it from the html altogether. If it is meant to be accessed, change the location of those links so they can be seen and accessed on-screen. The current setup provides two different experiences between people who are tabbing through the site vs. those who are working off of what they seen on the screen. Again, this idea of maintaining  consistency in experience is important to improve usability and reduce overall confusion when navigating the site.</p>
    <p>3. Reduce contrast errors by darkening the light blue and yellow links on the light grey and white backgrounds. Currently, this could be difficult for people with impaired vision to read the information that is listed to click. These errors are state that the colors do not pass AA accessibility standards. Adjusting the colors will improve the contrast ratio and make it easier for people to read and more likely to pass AA and AAA accessibility standards.</p>
    <p>4. Change the tabbing order for the page. The first tab should not go to the social media icons at the bottom of the page. It is not standard in general nor logical in this instance for the tabbing to behave like this. Instead it should start at the navigation in the header with the option of skipping to main content. This will follow general tab accessbility convention and allow users more freedom when dictating how they navigate throughout the page, especially by allowing them to get to the skip to main content option faster.</p>
