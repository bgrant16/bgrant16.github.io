      <p>Project Snapshot</p>
      <h1>Increasing Deposits with Design</h1>
      <p>Business had a goal to meet. We used research and design to get them on their way.</p>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>PenFed wanted to increase its deposits. The business had some of the highest certificate rates in the country but the online experience for opening a certificate of deposit (CD) had not been updated in many years.</p>
      <p>The existing application looked outdated and we wanted to streamline the process by improving the application flow.</p>
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Redesign the online experience for members opening new CDs to increase deposits.</p>
      <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <p>As part of discovery, I explored different financial institutions to examine different approaches to investing in a certificate of deposit. I was then able to identify key features that could be leveraged.</p>

      <p>I contributed to requirements gathering to speak for important user stories to be included.</p>
      <p>I iterated through many flow proposals to eventually get approval from the business owner, IT, compliance, and UX.</p>

      <p>Next I created low-fidelity wireframes and a clickable prototype to develop consensus among the project team. The prototype was also used to conduct user testing.</p>

        <img src="images/CertificateConfirmation.jpg" alt="Certificate Confirmation Wireframe">
        <p>Certificate of Deposit Application Wireframes</p>
      </div>
      <p>Feedback was incorporated into design before high fidelity wireframes were designed and delivered for development.</p>
      <h2>Analytics Tracking</h2>
      <p>I worked with the product owner and our Adobe Analytics team to determine what event tracking we wanted tagged in order to assess application performance analytics and frictions points.</p>
      <p>Our goal was to learn from our data collection in order to continually improve the application post-launch.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>The new CD application has received executive approval and is currently under development.</p>
      <div class="results">
