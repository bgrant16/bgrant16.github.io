    <p>Project Snapshot</p>
    <h1>Researching the Personal Loan Online Marketplace</h1>
    <p>I explored today's marketplace and found that customers are looking for more than just the lowest rate.</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>PenFed is a credit union with over 1.6 million members and $23 million in assets. PenFed offers among the lowest interest rates in the country and has a strong presence in the lending market.</p>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>PenFed’s personal loan application had not been updated in many years. Executives and product management requested the user experience team to lead the application redesign to ensure a better user experience for people looking to access PenFed’s great rates.</p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>I led the user research effort for the project. I conducted industry research, benchmarked competitors, conducted usability testing, and heuristic evaluation of the existing application.</p>
    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <p>Who are the borrowers?​</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Nearly 54 percent of adults age 55 and over stated they had taken out a personal loan</li>
      <li>49 percent of individuals age 35 to 54</li>
      <li>36 percent of those age 18 to 34</li>
      <li>Consumers who are perceived to be in a healthier financial state – (Source: Discover Personal Loans survey, 2016)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Why are they borrowing?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Major purchase financing</li>
      <li>Debt consolidation</li>
      <li>Interest rate reduction</li>
      <li>Credit Building</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What are the top factors in selecting a lender?</p>
    <p>While there is some variation among age groups, interest rate, trust, and ease of application were all significant factors for potential borrowers.</p>

    <p>How is the market landscape changing?</p>
    <p>There has been a shift in recent years of where consumers are getting their personal loans. A shift away from traditional banks towards online lenders suggests that consumer preferences are changing. It is important to take a look at what these lenders are doing to cause this shift.</p>

    <p>What are competitors doing well?</p>
    <p>I reviewed the experience for market leaders in the banking, credit union, and fintech space.</p>
    <p>Banks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wells Fargo</li>
      <li>TD Bank</li>
      <li>PNC</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Credit Unions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Navy Federal</li>
      <li>Alliant</li>
    </ul>
    <p>FinTech:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Discover</li>
      <li>Payoff</li>
      <li>Lending Club</li>
      <li>SoFi</li>
      <li>Avant</li>
    </ul>
    <p>1. Speak to customers with an engaging tone</p>
    <p>Friendliness became a theme when talking to users: How do we change the tone around money lending? Plain, conversational language was a trend.</p>
    <p>Example: "How much do you need to borrow?" instead of "Loan Amount"</p>
    <figure>

    </figure>
    <p>2. Offer a transparent and responsive process</p>
    <p>Cater towards the reasonable requests of informing people of what they will need up front and how long the process will take from application submission, to receiving a decision, to receiving the funds upon approval.</p>

    <p>How long will this take?</p>
    <p>Success trend: 10-15 minutes</p>

    <p>When and how will I receive my funds?</p>
    <p>Success trend: In user's bank account within 72 hours</p>

    </figure>
    <p>What are the terms of repayment?</p>
    <p>Success trend: "Let me decide how I pay you back"</p>
    <p>What happens after a loan decision?</p>
    <p>Success trend: Email, welcome packet, and what's next info</p>
    <p>3. A streamlined application with a logical flow</p>
    <p>Most of the applications allowed the customer to state their desired loan request (amount, term, etc) before being asked to provide their personal information. Customers want to feel attended to immediately; that the lender is listening & eager to fulfill their financial needs first.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="images/Discover.png" alt="First page of Discover application">

    </figure>
    <p>The applications reviewed varied from PenFed in terms of the information it was asking applicants to provide. Information such as number of dependents, vehicles owned, and employer address were not present in other applications.</p>
    <p>4. Provide interactive design elements that add value</p>
    <p>There were many design elements included in the applications that increased the consumer's confidence regarding their decision to apply:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Comparison charts of their loans vs. competitors</li>
      <li>Loan calculators, interest and term slider scales</li>
      <li>Ability to deposit approved loan directly into savings account</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <p>1. Eliminate information requests that aren't needed.</p>
    <p>2. Provide a friendly and clear tone with the tools to make customers confident in their decisions.</p>
    <p>3. Get applicants to a loan decision as fast as possible.</p>
    <p>4. Match user mental models of how the flow should progress.</p>
