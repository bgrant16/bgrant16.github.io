    <h1>Researching the Non-Profit Space Online</h1>
    <p>The PenFed Foundation has helped a lot of people in need. I conducted research for its site to improve its impact.</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The PenFed Foundation is a nonprofit committed to helping members of the military community secure their financial future. The Foundation provides assistance in many ways including zero interest loans, housing for wounded veterans and their families while receiving treatment, and mortgage grants.</p>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>The Foundation site was very outdated and did not communicate the purpose of the Foundation well. Needed to improve the site to ultimately increase awareness of the Foundation and improve the user experience.</p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>I reviewed 7 non-profit organization websites looking for trends in content and design.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</li>
      <li>The Clinton Foundation</li>
      <li>One Drop Foundation</li>
      <li>Fisher House Foundation</li>
      <li>Ford Foundation</li>
      <li>One.org</li>
      <li>USO</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These websites were selected for review based on a track record of success and relevance to the PenFed Foundation mission.</p>
    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <p>1. There are core questions that good sites answer to provide a narrative</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What are we working for or against?</li>
      <li>What are the factors contributing to the problems we are trying to solve?</li>
      <li>How, specifically, do we address these problems?</li>
      <li>How can someone engage with the organization?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>2. Strong first impression with compelling image and a succinct belief or mission statement</p>
    <p>This helps to anchor the user with an immediate sense for the mission of the organization and encourages the exploration of well-labeled navigation categories.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>3. Anchored navigation with “About” section, “Donate” button, and work overview</p>
    <p>All of the sites provided global navigation, most often anchored and horizontal across the top of the page, that included navigation to a general page about the organization giving background on the organization’s overall purpose and goals (most commonly labeled “About”). There was also consistently a link to an overview of the kind of work and projects the organization does and a prominent link to donate.</p>

    <p>4. Putting donations in context may be effective</p>
    <p>Of the 4 sites that solicit donations, 2 (One Drop & The Clinton Foundation) provides the context of what different donation amounts will accomplish with the organization. Tying donations directly back to the organization’s mission and giving a sense for how far different amounts can go may be enticing to engaged users thinking of making a donation.</p>

    <p>5. Craft content to let users feel like a part of it all</p>
    <p>5 of the 7 organizations reviewed have a “Get Involved” or “Take Action” link as part of their main navigation. These links lead to content that ranges from opportunities to volunteer, fundraise, and attend events to simply making comments in an online community.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>6. Depth of content provided to get more details on program specifics</p>
    <p>Many of the sites reviewed provided additional content beyond an overview of the program or program specifics.  This included blog posts, detailed topic briefs, and articles, whether written by external sources or internally produced.</p>
    <p>7. Numbers are compelling to emphasize the scale of the issue they’re fighting</p>
    <p>Some organizations choose to use the “about” area to provide numbers and statistics, either about the issue they focus on or the organization’s efficacy.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>8. Bold email solicitation</p>
    <p>Many of the sites reviewed featured prominent calls to action to provide an email address, with 2 (Clinton Foundation and Ford Foundation) using modal window that requires a user to interact to close it.</p>
    <p>9. Large bright graphics and large font</p>
    <p>Most of the websites reviewed are rich with large, brightly colored photos. These graphics draw attention, and often provide entry, to pieces of content and details about the organization programs.</p>
    <p>Most of the sites reviewed use font of at least 18 points for key content, with font as big as 46.4 for headlines (Ford Foundation).</p>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <p>1. Need to include at-a-glance information of overall mission and values.</p>
    <p>2. Need to communicate the importance and scale of the problems it is trying to address.</p>
    <p>3. Include numbers to highlight success of programs or give context to how far a donation will go.</p>
    <p>4. Increase depth of content on programs with more background on issues, blog posts, articles, etc.</p>
