    <h1>Enhancing the Credit Card Customer Experience</h1>
    <p>Our customers deserved an updated credit card application. So we gave it to them.</p>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>PenFed had not updated its online credit card application for many years.</p>
    <div class="existing credit card">
      <img src="images/ExistingContactInfo.jpg" alt="Existing Contact Info Page in Credit Card Application">
      <img src="images/ExistingReview.jpg" alt="Existing Review Page in Credit Card Application">
      <img src="images/ExistingDecision.jpg" alt="Existing Decision Page in Credit Card Application">
      <img src="images/ExistingFinalize.jpg" alt="Existing Finalize Page in Credit Card APplication">
      <p>Existing Credit Card Application</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>Redesign the online experience for members opening applying for credit cards.</p>
    <p>Leverage the application style guide we had established for other recent application redesigns.</p>
    <p>Increase application volume and net promoter score.</p>
    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>I iterated through many flow proposals to eventually get approval from the business owner, IT, compliance, and UX.</p>
    <p>The flow was streamlined after negotiating with compliance, reducing customer input fields, and ordering steps in a more intuitive manner.</p>
    <p>I worked with the credit card product owner to craft email correspondence for customers receiving application updates.</p>
    <p>We developed the content strategy and email design to highlight the most important information for the user to consume quickly.</p>
    <div class="emails">
      <img src="images/ApprovalEmail.jpg" alt="Approval Email">
      <img src="images/UnderReviewEmail.jpg" alt="Under Review Email">
      <img src="images/IncompleteEmail.jpg" alt="Incomplete Email">
      <img src="images/AbandonedEmail.jpg" alt="Abandoned Email">
      <p>Credit Card Emails</p>
    </div>
    <p>Feedback was incorporated into the application and email design before high-fidelity wireframes were designed and delivered for development.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The new credit card application has received executive approval and is currently under development.</p>
