    <h1>Helping Employees Serve Customers Better</h1>
    <p>Being in customer service can be fast-paced and hectic. An interface should not be slowing anyone down.</p>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>PenFed was migrating its customer service platform to SalesForce.</p>
    <p>This gave us the opportunity to update the design of the old system for a better customer service representative experience.</p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>Redesign the online experience with feedback from PenFed service reps so they could better assist PenFed members.</p>
    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>I conducted contextual inquiry by shadowing PenFed customer service reps as they helped members at call centers and in the branch using the existing software.

    <p>I participated in the requirements gathering to contribute to the user stories.</p>
    <p>I collaborated with the project team to develop low-fidelity wireframes and a clickable prototype.</p>

    <p>I used the prototype to gain feedback from the project team and customer service reps. This feedback provided insight to iterate and drive design forward.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The new customer service platform was designed and delivered to the development team for production in order to help employees deliver better customer service.</p>
