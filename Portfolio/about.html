    <h1>Friends and Family Call Me Billy</h1>
    <p>I'm a first year graduate student at the University of Michigan studying User Experience and Human-Computer Interaction. <br><br>
      I moved around a lot as a kid since both of my parents were in the Army. That being said, I call D.C. home. <br><br>
      I'm decent with a soccer ball at my feet and a Fuji X-M1 camera in my hands.<br><br>
      I'm a big time podcast consumer and am always down for a discussion about the future of autonomous vehicles. Dinner with Malcolm Gladwell and Donald Glover would be a dream.<br><br>
      Interested in talking? Feel free to reach me by any means below.</p>
